The last flag and final hint: Script tags are great, but what other options do you have?

If you go to "Markdown Test" page, you'll see a button that seems useless.

You can edit this page and the button. Manipulating this requires more knowledge in JavaScript. You can basically give the button an action that runs a script.
I used the "onclick" action and set it to a script.

Save this and when you click on the button, you don't get anything, but it did render. Just in a hidden spot

If you go to page source, you'll see that flag is there.
